# Document-Scanner

- In this project, I have created an automated Document Scanner application, instead of marking the 4 points manually.This code will take an image of a document as an input and   produce a transformed and correctly warped image.

- Input Image
![scanned-form](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbf470a4-12a4-4da7-8afa-6312d3fedf53)

- Expected output
![scanned_output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c90ac3d3-5fcc-4c98-99d5-6114939607a2)
