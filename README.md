# Document-Scanner

- In this project, I have created an automated Document Scanner application, instead of marking the 4 points manually.This code will take an image of a document as an input and   produce a transformed and correctly warped image.

# I have followed the following steps

1. Preprocessing and Contour Detection

2. Contour Approximation

3. Perspective Transformation
